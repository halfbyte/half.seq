The first application should be a controller-only variant, as this will be the easiest to set up and will already contain vital parts.

first version could be compatible with monome protocol (neglecting the encoders for a start). This would allow me to use all the available monome applications. 

also, it could simply follow the protocol of the monomeserial application over midi (would probably give better performance)

this would allow me to prototype the sequencer application in ruby or a similar language and would give a good feedback on how many additional  controls will be necessary for the final half/seq application.

needed building blocks:

- serial/MIDI i/o
- LED driver
- button/encoder driver with debouncing
